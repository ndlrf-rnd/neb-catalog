A dark imagination, a sinister smile--always on the outside of the group. Some part of you suspected he might be capable of doing something awful. Twenty-five years ago, Crabtree did just that, committing a murder so shocking that it's attracted that strange kind of infamy that only exists on the darkest corners of the internet--and inspired more than one copycat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Paul Adams remembers the case all too well: Crabtree--and his victim--were Paul's friends.

Paul learns that Detective Amanda Beck is investigating another copycat that has struck in the nearby town of Featherbank. His mother is distressed, insistent that there's something in the house. And someone is following him. Which reminds him of the most unsettling thing about that awful day twenty-five years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e It wasn't just the murder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e It was the fact that afterward, Charlie Crabtree was never seen again...\u003c/p\u003e",

Her husband has left her for Eve, rich and childless, and Hannah has been surviving by becoming a cleaner in London.

Chiara was reading a novel, oblivious to the television, which was muted. On the screen was a live shot of St. Peter\u0026#8217;s Basilica. Gabriel raised the volume and learned that an old friend had died \u0026#8230;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eGabriel Allon has slipped quietly into Venice for a much-needed holiday with his wife and two young children. But when Pope Paul VII dies suddenly, Gabriel is summoned to Rome by the Holy Father\u0026#8217;s loyal private secretary, Archbishop Luigi Donati. A billion Catholic faithful have been told that the pope died of a heart attack. Donati, however, has two good reasons to suspect his master was murdered. The Swiss Guard who was standing watch outside the papal apartments the night of the pope\u0026#8217;s death is missing. So, too, is the letter the Holy Father was writing during the final hours of his life. A letter that was addressed to Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhile researching in the Vatican Secret Archives, I came upon a most remarkable book \u0026#8230;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eThe book is a long-suppressed gospel that calls into question the accuracy of the New Testament\u0026#8217;s depiction of one of the most portentous events in human history. For that reason alone, the Order of St. Helena will stop at nothing to keep it out of Gabriel\u0026#8217;s hands. A shadowy Catholic society with ties to the European far right, the Order is plotting to seize control of the papacy. And it is only the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eAs the cardinals gather in Rome for the start of the conclave, Gabriel sets out on a desperate search for proof of the Order\u0026#8217;s conspiracy, and for a long-lost gospel with the power to put an end to two thousand years of murderous hatred. His quest will take him from the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, to a monastery in Assisi, to the hidden depths of the Secret Archives, and finally to the Sistine Chapel, where he will witness an event no outsider has ever before seen\u0026#8212;the sacred passing of the Keys of St. Peter to a newly elected pope.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eSwiftly paced and elegantly rendered, The Order will hold readers spellbound, from its opening passages to its breathtaking final twist of plot. It is a novel of friendship and faith in a perilous and uncertain world. And it is still more proof that Daniel Silva is his generation\u0026#8217;s finest writer of suspense and international intrigue.\u0026#160;\u003c/p\u003e",

And years ago, on Excel\u0026#8217;s tenth birthday, Maxima revealed a secret that he must keep forever. \u0026#8220;We are \u0026#8216;TNT\u0026#8217;\u0026#8212;tago ng tago,\u0026#8221; she told him, \u0026#8220;hiding and hiding.\u0026#8221; Excel is undocumented\u0026#8212;and one accidental slip could uproot his entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCasting aside the paranoia and secrecy of his childhood, Excel takes a leap, joining Sab on a journey south to a ramshackle desert town called Hello City. Populated by drifters, old hippies, and washed-up techies\u0026#8212;and existing outside the normal constructs of American society\u0026#8212;Hello City offers Excel a chance to forge his own path for the first time. But after so many years of trying to be invisible, who does he want to become? And is it possible to put down roots in a country that has always considered you an outsider?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrumming with energy and at once critical and hopeful, The Son of Good Fortune is a luminous story of a mother and son testing the strength of their bond to their country\u0026#8212;and to each other.\u003c/p\u003e",

It was the last time anyone would see her alive. By the next day, Shanann and her two young daughters, Bella and Celeste, had been reported missing, and her husband, Chris Watts, was appearing on the local news, pleading for his family's safe return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Chris Watts already knew that he would never see his family again. Less than 24 hours after his desperate plea, Watts made a shocking confession to police: he had strangled his pregnant wife to death and smothered their daughters, dumping their bodies at a nearby oil site. Heartbroken friends and neighbors watched in shock as the movie-star handsome, devoted family man they knew was arrested and charged with first degree murder. The mask Chris had presented to the world in his TV interviews and the family's Facebook accounts was slipping--and what lay beneath was a horrifying image of instability, infidelity, and boiling rage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this first major account of the case, bestselling author and journalist John Glatt reveals the truth behind the tragedy and constructs a chilling portrait of one of the most shocking family annihilator cases of the 21st century.\u003c/p\u003e",

The person is genderless and racially ambiguous and refuses to speak. One family takes in the strange visitor and nicknames them Pew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the town spends the week preparing for a mysterious Forgiveness Festival, Pew is shuttled from one household to the next. The earnest and seemingly well-meaning townspeople see conflicting identities in Pew, and many confess their fears and secrets to them in one-sided conversations. Pew listens and observes while experiencing brief flashes of past lives or clues about their origin. As days pass, the void around Pew's presence begins to unnerve the community, whose generosity erodes into menace and suspicion. Yet by the time Pew's story reaches a shattering and unsettling climax at the Forgiveness Festival, the secret of who they really are--a devil or an angel or something else entirely--is dwarfed by even larger truths. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003ePew\u003c/i\u003e, Catherine Lacey's third novel, is a foreboding, provocative, and amorphous fable about the world today: its contradictions, its flimsy morality, and the limits of judging others based on their appearance. With precision and restraint, one of our most beloved and boundary-pushing writers holds up a mirror to her characters' true selves, revealing something about forgiveness, perception, and the faulty tools society uses to categorize human complexity.\u003c/p\u003e",

She shares the curator's fascination with the hidden forms of the animal kingdom--with camouflage and subterfuge--and she proposes that they collaborate on an exhibition, the form of which itself remains largely obscure, even as they enter into a strange relationship marked by evasion and elision.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeven years later, after the death of the designer, the curator recovers the archive of their never-completed project. During a long night of insomnia, he finds within the archive a series of clues to the true story of the designer's family, a mind-bending puzzle that winds from Haifa, Israel, to bohemian 1970s New York to the Latin American jungle. On the way, he discovers a cast of characters whose own fixations interrogate the unstable frontiers between art, science, politics, and religion: an aging photographer, living nearly alone in an abandoned mining town where subterranean fires rage without end, who creates models of ruined cities; a former model turned conceptual artist--and a defendant in a trial over the very nature and purpose of art; a young indigenous boy who has received a vision of the end of the world. Reality is a curtain, as the curator realizes, and to draw it back is to reveal the theater of obsession.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eNatural History\u003c/i\u003e is the portrait of a world trapped between faith and irony, between tragedy and farce. A defiantly contemporary and impressively ambitious novel in the tradition of Italo Calvino and Ricardo Piglia, it confirms Carlos Fonseca as one of the most daring writers of his generation.\u003c/p\u003e",

A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora hasn't spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of the press, the Internet, the paparazzi, and the government--and with him in hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father's leaks are a hoax, and wants nothing to do with him--until she learns just how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up, and that an extraterrestrial presence has been on Earth for decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Realizing the extent to which both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information as she can, and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter, becoming the first and only human vessel of communication. Their otherworldly connection will change everything she thought she knew about being human--and could unleash a force more sinister than she ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e",

But Daniel\u0026#8217;s arrival coincides with the awakening of the Mauna Loa volcano, and its dangerous path toward their village stirs both new and long ago passions in their community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlternating between past and present\u0026#8212;from the day of the volcano eruption in 1935 to decades prior\u0026#8212;\u003cem\u003eThe Color of Air\u003c/em\u003e interweaves the stories of Daniel, Koji, and Mariko to create a rich, vibrant, bittersweet chorus that celebrates their lifelong bond to one other and to their immigrant community.

He's aware of the racial injustice all around him--the segregationist politicians, the corrupt cops, the violent Klan members--but he feels powerless to make a difference. That all changes when he crosses paths with an impassioned coed named Ginger Raines. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGinger introduces him to a lively and diverse group of civil rights activists, folk singers, and night club performers--men and women who live authentically despite the conformist values of their hometown. Emboldened by this new community, Toland joins the local protests and even finds the courage to venture into a gay bar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo longer content to stay on the sidelines, Toland unites with his friends as they fight against bigotry. But in Clayfield, Alabama, that can be dangerous--even deadly.\u003c/p\u003e",

An unknown band called Pulp once asked him to produce their next album. (He said no.) An unknown band called Of Montreal once invited him to go on tour with them. (He said no.) He's collaborated with fans Vampire Weekend and with the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merrit. He's had an impression of his penis preserved by the notorious Cynthia Plaster Caster. Maybe you've heard of him. Probably you haven't. This is his story. Or, rather, stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than one avuncular tell-all relayed in his own voice, Momus has structured the narrative of his life as a typically atypical mockery of the rock-bio oral history. Instead of using living witnesses, Momus assumes the voices of 217 dead authors and artists and forces them to speak for and about him. From these dramatic monologues--sometimes unreliable, often comical--there gradually emerges a picture of one eccentric star's life across three continents and in his own, remarkable, niche.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\"Herein is spun the tale of the immortally fabulous life and glittering times of our dodgy Anthropocene's greatest still-living songwriter, as related by a chorus of eerie, mocking, sometimes supportive, often judgmental post-mortem Raudive voices in a séance spanning centuries of ectoplasmic 'I told you so.' Here is why Momus may one day be canonized the first saint of a religion yet to be dreamed . . .

How can it be measured, improved, or built? Are character traits fixed or changeable? Is character innate, or can it be taught?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince at least the time of Aristotle, philosophers, theologians, moralists, artists, and scientists have engaged with the enigma of human character. In its oldest usage, \"character\" derives from a word for engraving or stamping, yet over time, it has come to mean a moral idea, a type, a literary persona, and a physical or physiological manifestation, observable in works of art and scientific experiments. It is an essential term in drama and the focus of self-help books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn \u003ci\u003eCharacter: The History of a Cultural Obsession\u003c/i\u003e, Marjorie Garber points out that character seems more relevant than ever today--the term is omnipresent in discussions of politics, ethics, gender, morality, and the psyche. References to character flaws, character issues, character assassination, and allegations of \"bad\" and \"good\" character are inescapable in the media and in contemporary political debates. \u003cbr\u003eWhat connection does \"character,\" in this moral or ethical sense, have with the concept of a character in a novel or a play? Do our notions about fictional characters help to produce our ideas about moral character? Can character be formed, or taught, in schools, in scouting, in the home? From Plutarch to John Stuart Mill, from Shakespeare to Darwin, from Theophrastus to Freud, from nineteenth-century phrenology to twenty-first-century brain scans, the search for the sources and components of human character still preoccupies us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe question of character arises in virtually every area of modern life. And in each case, there is the same fundamental tension: is it innate or intrinsic to the individual, or something that can be learned or modeled? At a time when both the meaning and the value of this term are put in question, no issue is more important, and no topic more vital, surprising, and fascinating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith her distinctive verve, humor, and vast erudition, Marjorie Garber explores the stakes of these conflations, confusions, and heritages, from ancient Greece to the present day.\u003c/p\u003e",

For Cohen, simultaneously grief-stricken and buoyed by the birth of her daughter, reading Austen became her refuge and her ballast. She was able to reckon with difficult questions about mourning, memorializing, living in a household, paying attention to the world, reading, writing, and imagining through Austen's novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eAusten Years\u003c/i\u003e is a deeply felt and sensitive examination of a writer's relationship to reading, and to her own family, winding together memoir, criticism, and biographical and historical material about Austen herself. And like the sequence of Austen's novels, the scope of \u003ci\u003eAusten Years\u003c/i\u003e widens successively, with each chapter following one of Austen's novels. We begin with Cohen in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she raises her small children and contemplates her father's last letter, a moment paired with the grief of \u003ci\u003eSense and Sensibility\u003c/i\u003e  and the social bonds of \u003ci\u003ePride and Prejudice\u003c/i\u003e. Later, moving with her family to Chicago, Cohen grapples with her growing children, teaching, and her father's legacy, all refracted through the denser, more complex \u003ci\u003eMansfield Park \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eEmma\u003c/i\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith unusual depth and fresh insight into Austen's life and literature, and guided by Austen's mournful and hopeful final novel, \u003ci\u003ePersuasion\u003c/i\u003e, Rachel Cohen's \u003ci\u003eAusten Years\u003c/i\u003e is a rare memoir of mourning and transcendence, a love letter to a literary master, and a powerful consideration of the odd process that merges our interior experiences with the world at large.\u003c/p\u003e",

Orwell based the book on events up to and during Joseph Stalin\u0026#39;s regime. Orwell, a democratic socialist, and a member of the Independent Labour Party for many years, was a critic of Stalin, and was suspicious of Moscow-directed Stalinism after his experiences in the Spanish Civil War.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe plot is an allegory in which the pigs in a farm play the role of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and overthrow and oust the human owners of the farm, setting it up as a commune in which, at first, all animals are equal. The other characters have their parallels in the real world, but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe novel was chosen by TIME Magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEric Arthur Blair\u003c/strong\u003e, better known by his pen name\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eGeorge Orwell\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e(1903\u0026ndash;1950), was an English author and journalist. His work is marked by keen intelligence and wit, a profound awareness of social injustice, an intense opposition to totalitarianism, a passion for clarity in language, and a belief in democratic socialism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to his literary career Orwell served as a police officer with the Indian Imperial Police in Burma from 1922-1927 and fought with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War from 1936-1937. He was severely wounded when he was shot through his throat. Orwell and his wife were accused of \u0026#39;Rabid Trotskyism\u0026#39; and tried in absentia in Barcelona, along with other leaders of the POUM, in 1938. However by then they had escaped from Spain and returned to England.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBetween 1941 and 1943, Orwell worked on propaganda for the BBC. In 1943, he became literary editor of the Tribune, a weekly left-wing magazine. He was a prolific polemical journalist, article writer, literary critic, reviewer, poet and writer of fiction, and considered perhaps the twentieth century\u0026#39;s best chronicler of English culture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrwell is best known for the dystopian novel\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eNineteen Eighty-Four\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(published in 1949) and the satirical novella\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eAnimal Farm\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(1945)\u0026mdash;they have together sold more copies than any two books by any other twentieth-century author.

Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round\u0026mdash;more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn\u0026#39;t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable.

            "description": "From a Western point of view, the policy of economic engagement with China has failed. A rapid rise in living standards in China has helped legitimize and strengthen the Chinese Communist Party’s power. How did Western, market-orientated, property-owning, liberal democracies go from being in a position of complete global hegemony in the early 1990s to the current crisis of confidence and loss of moral foundation? This book tells the story of the most successful trading nation of the early twenty-first century. It looks at how the Communist Party of China has retained and cemented its monopoly on political power since China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in December 2001. It is the most extraordinary economic success story of our time and it has reshaped the geopolitics not just of Asia but of the world. As China has come to dominate global manufacturing, its economic power has been translated into political power, and the West now has a global rival that is politically antithetical to liberal values. The supply-side deflation from allowing 750 million low-cost workers into the global trading system combined with the policy of inflation targeting by Western central banks has led to falling real incomes for many in the West and rising asset prices that have benefited the few. Worse still, China’s mercantilist model is now held up as a viable economic alternative. To have a fighting chance of protecting the freedoms of liberal democracies, it is of the utmost importance that we understand how the policy of indulgent engagement with China has affected Western society in recent years. Only then can the global trading system be reoriented for the mutual benefit of all nations.",

Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid. He skips school to swim and is made to whitewash the fence the next day as punishment. He cleverly persuades his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work. He then trades the treasures for Sunday School tickets which one normally receives for memorizing verses consistently, redeeming them for a Bible, much to the surprise and bewilderment of the superintendent who thought \u0026quot;it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises\u0026mdash;a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.\u0026quot;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nTom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \u0026quot;engaged\u0026quot; by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been \u0026quot;engaged\u0026quot; previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness a trio of body snatchers, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter, and Injun Joe, getting into a fight. While Potter is knocked unconscious during the scuffle, Injun Joe stabs the doctor to death and later pins the blame on Potter, who is arrested for the murder. Potter is then shunned by the whole town, except Huck and Tom, who knew the real story. They decided \u0026quot;to keep mum\u0026quot; about this incident because they are afraid of Injun Joe murdering them.",

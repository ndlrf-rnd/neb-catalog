Through a revolutionary method known as somaforming, astronauts can survive in hostile environments off Earth using synthetic biological supplementations. They can produce antifreeze in sub-zero temperatures, absorb radiation and convert it for food, and conveniently adjust to the pull of different gravitational forces. With the fragility of the body no longer a limiting factor, human beings are at last able to explore neighbouring exoplanets long suspected to harbour life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAriadne is one such explorer. On a mission to ecologically survey four habitable worlds fifteen light-years from Earth, she and her fellow crewmates sleep while in transit, and wake each time with different features. But as they shift through both form and time, life back on Earth has also changed. Faced with the possibility of returning to a planet that has forgotten those who have left, Ariadne begins to chronicle the wonders and dangers of her journey, in the hope that someone back home might still be listening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cfont size=\"+1\"\u003e\u003cb\u003ePRAISE FOR THE WAYFARERS\u003c/b\u003e \u003c/font\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cb\u003e'Becky Chambers is a wonder, and I feel better for having her books in my life' \u003c/b\u003eJOHN CONNOLLY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e'In a word, brilliant' ANDREW CALDECOTT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e'A short but fierce ode to humanity and all our reaches and flaws.

A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora hasn't spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of the press, the Internet, the paparazzi, and the government--and with him in hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father's leaks are a hoax, and wants nothing to do with him--until she learns just how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up, and that an extraterrestrial presence has been on Earth for decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Realizing the extent to which both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information as she can, and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter, becoming the first and only human vessel of communication. Their otherworldly connection will change everything she thought she knew about being human--and could unleash a force more sinister than she ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e",

Instead, they discover grim truths about the price of life in the void. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, Seske is unexpectedly thrust into the role of clan matriarch, responsible for thousands of lives in a harsh universe where a single mistake can be fatal. Her claim to the throne is challenged by a rival determined to overthrow her and take control\u0026#8212;her intelligent, cunning, and confident sister. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeske may not be a born leader like her sister, yet her unorthodox outlook and incorruptible idealism may be what the clan needs to save themselves and their world.\u003c/p\u003e",

The Mems exist as mirror-images of their source — zombie-like creatures destined to experience that singular memory over and over, until they expire in the cavernous Vault where they are kept. \u003cbr\u003eAnd then there is Dolores Extract #1, the first Mem capable of creating her own memories. An ageless beauty shrouded in mystery, she is allowed to live on her own, and create her own existence, until one day she is summoned back to the Vault. What happens next is a gorgeously rendered, heart-breaking novel in the vein of Kazuo Ishiguro’s \u003ci\u003eNever Let Me Go\u003c/i\u003e.\nDebut novelist Bethany Morrow has created an allegory for our own time, exploring profound questions of ownership, and how they relate to identity, memory and history, all in the shadows of Montreal’s now forgotten slave trade.",

The ensuing climate cataclysm will soon render the earth inhospitable for humanity, as the last such meteorite did for the dinosaurs. This looming threat calls for a radically accelerated effort to colonize space, and requires a much larger share of humanity to take part in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElma York's experience as a WASP pilot and mathematician earns her a place in the International Aerospace Coalition's attempts to put man on the moon, as a calculator.

It instantaneously links us to all information and global events as they break. Every interaction, every emotion, every image can be shared through it; it is the essential tool everyone relies on to know and understand the thoughts and feelings of partners, parents, friends, children, colleagues, bosses, employees . . . in fact, of anyone and everyone else in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTom and Kate use the Feed, but Tom has resisted its addiction, which makes him suspect to his family. After all, his father created it. But that opposition to constant connection serves Tom and Kate well when the Feed collapses after a horrific tragedy shatters the world as they know it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Feed\u0026#8217;s collapse, taking modern society with it, leaves people scavenging to survive. Finding food is truly a matter of life and death. Minor ailments, previously treatable, now kill. And while the collapse has demolished the trappings of the modern world, it has also eroded trust. In a world where survival of the fittest is a way of life, there is no one to depend upon except yourself . . . and maybe even that is no longer true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTom and Kate have managed to protect themselves and their family. But then their six-year-old daughter, Bea, goes missing. Who has taken her? How do you begin to look for someone in a world without technology? And what happens when you can no longer even be certain that the people you love are really who they claim to be?\u003c/p\u003e",

The book follows a year of changes and the travels of a housecat and a lion who are inexplicably driven towards a rendezvous. At first, a few isolated harbingers of change appear, but they quickly escalate. Squirrels take up manic knitting, wild hares steal earth-moving equipment, rats go in for disco music and form-fitting metallic leisure-ware. Data-sorting abilities appear among urban populations of birds, and frenzied domestic pets seek celebrity careers. Droll, melancholic, and poetic, the tale is crammed with witty vignettes and poignant reflections on the ways the pressures on the once-natural world are accelerating mutations in behaviors among the animals. Genetic material alters. The differences between animals blur. Odd mutant forms appear–goat-chicks and dog-flies, fish-birds and flying lizards–as if some mad rush is propelling genetic code to propagate across every form of flesh and living matter. As large-scale infrastructure projects make their appearance, each of the animals takes the role appropriate to its disposition—or not. Melancholic rather than apocalyptic, the book is a celebration of species as well as a mourning of the damage done in our time. Throughout, the emergent voice and character of the \u003ci\u003eArchaean\u003c/i\u003e extremophile records events as well as a slow coming to consciousness about its own identity as a hyper-organism.",

The ensuing climate cataclysm will soon render the earth inhospitable for humanity, as the last such meteorite did for the dinosaurs. This looming threat calls for a radically accelerated effort to colonize space, and requires a much larger share of humanity to take part in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElma York's experience as a WASP pilot and mathematician earns her a place in the International Aerospace Coalition's attempts to put man on the moon, as a calculator.

Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide; the third expedition in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In \u003ci\u003eAnnihilation\u003c/i\u003e, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition.\u003cbr\u003e     The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.\u003cbr\u003e     They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers--they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding--but it's the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.\u003c/p\u003e",

Yet as this extraordinary novel tells the story of three murders committed by Glass the reader will be surprised to find out that it was Glass who was the killer and how he did it. And by the end of the book our sympathies for the killer are fully engaged.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRiffing on the tropes of crime fiction (the country house murder, the locked room mystery) and imbued with the feel of golden age SF, JACK GLASS is another bravura performance from Roberts. Whatever games he plays with the genre, whatever questions he asks of the reader, Roberts never loses sight of the need to entertain and JACK GLASS has some wonderfully gruesome moments, is built around three gripping HowDunnits and comes with liberal doses of sly humour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoberts invites us to have fun and tricks us into thinking about both crime and SF via a beautifully structured novel set in a society whose depiction challanges notions of crime, punishment, power and freedom. It is an extraordinary novel.\u003c/p\u003e",

Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through Alaska's ice. Thus was Dr. Blue's Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of downtown Seattle and unearthing a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who breathed it into the living dead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and toxic city. Just beyond it lives Blue's widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. Until Ezekiel undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis quest will take him under the wall and into a city teeming with ravenous undead, air pirates, criminal overlords, and heavily armed refugees. And only Briar can bring him out alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.\u003c/p\u003e",

Orwell based the book on events up to and during Joseph Stalin\u0026#39;s regime. Orwell, a democratic socialist, and a member of the Independent Labour Party for many years, was a critic of Stalin, and was suspicious of Moscow-directed Stalinism after his experiences in the Spanish Civil War.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe plot is an allegory in which the pigs in a farm play the role of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and overthrow and oust the human owners of the farm, setting it up as a commune in which, at first, all animals are equal. The other characters have their parallels in the real world, but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe novel was chosen by TIME Magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEric Arthur Blair\u003c/strong\u003e, better known by his pen name\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eGeorge Orwell\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e(1903\u0026ndash;1950), was an English author and journalist. His work is marked by keen intelligence and wit, a profound awareness of social injustice, an intense opposition to totalitarianism, a passion for clarity in language, and a belief in democratic socialism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to his literary career Orwell served as a police officer with the Indian Imperial Police in Burma from 1922-1927 and fought with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War from 1936-1937. He was severely wounded when he was shot through his throat. Orwell and his wife were accused of \u0026#39;Rabid Trotskyism\u0026#39; and tried in absentia in Barcelona, along with other leaders of the POUM, in 1938. However by then they had escaped from Spain and returned to England.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBetween 1941 and 1943, Orwell worked on propaganda for the BBC. In 1943, he became literary editor of the Tribune, a weekly left-wing magazine. He was a prolific polemical journalist, article writer, literary critic, reviewer, poet and writer of fiction, and considered perhaps the twentieth century\u0026#39;s best chronicler of English culture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrwell is best known for the dystopian novel\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eNineteen Eighty-Four\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(published in 1949) and the satirical novella\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eAnimal Farm\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(1945)\u0026mdash;they have together sold more copies than any two books by any other twentieth-century author.

I had read H. G. Wells\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;The Time Machine,\u0026rdquo; as who has not, deeming it fantastic fiction. Wells\u0026rsquo; story is fantastic fiction, of course, though scarcely as fantastic as what I experienced.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhen I seated myself in the Professor\u0026rsquo;s time machine that night and pushed over the lever, I have no need to tell you that I was in a drunken and reckless mood. The room turned around me like a pin-wheel, dissolved into mist. I was conscious of the terrible vibration of the machine, of a deathly sickness at the pit of my stomach. Blackness followed the mist. Wells describes what the character in his story saw as he journeyed into the future, the procession of days and nights ever accelerating their motion, but I saw nothing like that, perhaps from the beginning the speed was too great. Terrified, bewildered, I yet retained enough presence of mind to depress the lever into neutral and so bring the machine to a halt. Moments passed while I lolled in my seat, blind, dazed; then my vision cleared\u0026mdash;I could see. It was day. Sunlight fell around me. Everything was strange\u0026mdash;and different. How can I make you see what I saw? The machine stood near one end of a great, open square that was surrounded by massive buildings. Those buildings! I had never seen their like before. And yet there was a similarity of line, of mathematical precision which linked them with the architecture of New York and Chicago. It was as if the building construction of to-day had been carried to an extreme length. As if the machine had carried it forward. I did not think that at the moment, but later\u0026hellip;.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe walls of the massive buildings were broken by yawning doorways. So this, I thought, is the future; it can be nothing less than that. I stepped out of the machine, holding on to it for support, still feeling terribly sick and giddy. Then I saw the cylinders! They came gliding from one of the openings in an upright fashion, and this was the singular thing about them, that their means of locomotion were not apparent to the eye. There were no wheels or treads. They appeared to skim the stone or concrete with which the square was paved, rather than touch it. Oddly repellent they were, and intimidating, and I loosened the automatic in its shoulder holster\u0026mdash;the small one I always carry\u0026mdash;and prepared for emergencies, though bullets were useless against the cylinders as I was to discover later.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe cylinders were smooth things about five feet tall, of a dulled metal hue, with here and there shining spots which constantly waxed and waned in color. They were machines\u0026mdash;I thought of them as machines\u0026mdash;and it was reasonable to suppose that behind them lurked a human intelligence. The people of the future, I thought, have invented devices unknown to us of the Twentieth Century; and it came over me how wonderful it was going to be to meet those superior people, talk to them, gaze upon the marvels with which they had surrounded themselves.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSo I went to meet the cylinders...\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eAnthology containing:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n- The Machine Stops \u0026mdash; by E.

As the ship's new gunnery officer and only Kashmiri, he must constantly prove himself better than his Aquilan crewmates, even if he has to use his fists. When the \u003ci\u003eHector \u003c/i\u003eis called to help with a planetary uprising, he'll have to earn his unit's respect, find who's arming the rebels, and deal with the headstrong daughter of the colonial ruler--all while dodging bullets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eRestless Lightning\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e: Lieutenant Sikander North has avoided an outright court martial and finds himself assigned to a remote outpost in the crumbling, alien Tzoru Empire--where the navy sends trouble-makers to be forgotten. When Sikander finds himself in the middle of an alien uprising, he, once again, must do the impossible: smuggle an alien ambassador off-world, break a siege, and fight the irrational prejudice of his superior officers. The odds are against his success, and his choices could mean disgrace--or redemption.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eScornful Stars\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e: Now a captain, Sikander Singh North commands the destroyer \u003ci\u003eDecisive\u003c/i\u003e, assigned to Zerzura, a haven for piracy and the next playing-board in the Great Game. The Aquilan Commonwealth and the Empire of Dremark vie for the allegiance of local ruler Marid Pasha, a competition with stakes that reach far beyond the sector's pirate-infested limits. Sikander must stop the pirate attacks while charting his course between the ambitions of Marid Pasha, a dubious alliance with a shipping magnate, and the inexperience of \u003ci\u003eDecisive\u003c/i\u003e's crew...a situation that only grows more complicated when an old enemy returns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.\u003c/p\u003e",

But Danner is no altruist. He spends his life trying to cope with his abilities, becoming a sports hero in college, later a sideshow act, a war hero, never truly finding peace with himself. The character of Danner inspired both Superman\u0026#39;s creators, and Lester Dent\u0026#39;s Doc Savage. But Wylie, an editor with the New Yorker, sought to develop more than a pulp hero. His Gladiator provides surprising insights into the difficulties suffered by the truly gifted when born in our midst.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis novel is widely assumed to have been an inspiration for Superman.",

Kyle Umber, a religious idealist, has built Haven, a sanctuary above the distant planet Uranus.

A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora hasn't spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of the press, the Internet, the paparazzi, and the government--and with him in hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father's leaks are a hoax, and wants nothing to do with him--until she learns just how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up, and that an extraterrestrial presence has been on Earth for decades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Realizing the extent to which both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information as she can, and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter, becoming the first and only human vessel of communication. Their otherworldly connection will change everything she thought she knew about being human--and could unleash a force more sinister than she ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e",

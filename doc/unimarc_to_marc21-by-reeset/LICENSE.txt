Original license note:

---

I wish I could give a more definitive license.  I'm not sure where the
templates that I used originated.  They were provided to me via MarcEdit's
bug reporting -- so I'm not sure who to credit.  However, finding transformations
related to Unimarc and Marc21 can be a pain, so I offer these.  For my part of
this work, I release these changes into the public domain -- and welcome folks to use them as they like.

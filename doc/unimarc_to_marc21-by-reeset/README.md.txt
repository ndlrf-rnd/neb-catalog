# unimarc
Unimarc to MARC xslts MarcEdit uses as part of it's transformations

These transformations are provided as a part of MarcEdit.  These provide conversions between MarcXML and Unimarc.  

** Note about the provenance ** 

I didn't write these from scratch.  I was provided templates at some point over the past couple of years and had been keeping these in my queue for later development.  I'm not sure where these came from.  They were incomplete for my purposes, but it was fantastic to have a base.  For my part, you are allowed to use these files for whatever purpose you'd like.
